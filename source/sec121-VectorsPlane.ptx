      In this section, we transition from single-variable calculus to the geometry of the plane by introducing <term>vectors</term>. 
      We will learn how to describe quantities that have both magnitude and direction, perform algebraic operations on them, and use them to model physical forces.

  <subsection xml:id="subsec-BasicVectorR2">
    <title>Vectors in <m>\boldsymbol{\R^2}</m></title>

    <p>
      In case you are not familiar with the notation <m>\R^2</m>, it simply means the set of all ordered pairs of real numbers. 
      Symbolically speaking, 
      <md>
        \R^2 = \R \times \R = \left\{(x,y) \mid x,y\in \R\right\}
      </md>
      That is, we will work with vectors in two dimensions in this section. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's first define what a vector is in <m>\R^2</m>. 
      A <term>vector</term> in <m>\R^2</m> is an object determined by two points in the plane: an initial point <m>P</m> (the tail) and a terminal point <m>Q</m> (the tip). 
      We write 
      <md>
        \v{v} = \overrightarrow{PQ}
      </md>
      and we draw <m>\v{v}</m> as an arrow pointing from <m>P</m> to <m>Q</m>. 
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="sec121-fig-BasicVectorR2">
      <caption>The vector <m>\v{v} = \overrightarrow{PQ}</m> in <m>\R^2</m></caption>
      <image source="sec121-BasicVector-R2.png" width="50%">
      </image>
    </figure>

    <note>
      <title>Why is <m>\v{v}</m> bolded but not <m>P</m> or <m>Q</m>? </title>
      <p>
        This is a notation convention. 
        There is a difference between a vector and a point (or scalar). 
        To specify the difference, we usually <alert>bold</alert> the vector notation. 
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, if you see something like <m>\v{u}</m>, then this indicates that <m>\v{u}</m> is a vector. 
        As a comparison, if you see something like <m>u</m>, then this indicates that <m>u</m> is a scalar (a number). 
      </p>

      <p>
        But why don't we bold the vector <m>\overrightarrow{PQ}</m> as <m>\v{PQ}</m>, but instead put an arrow on top of it? 
      </p>

      <p>
        That is because the arrow notation specifies the tail and the tip of the vector! 
        There is a difference between <m>\overrightarrow{PQ}</m> and <m>\overrightarrow{QP}</m>! 
        They have the opposite tail and tip, so they point in opposite directions! 
      </p>

      <p>
        Another reason why sometimes we use the arrow notation is because <em>it is super difficult to write in bold font!</em>
        This is why Richard often writes <m>\overrightarrow{\, v\, }</m> on the board to indicate the vector <m>\v{v}</m>, since he can't write in bold font easily... 
      </p>
    </note>

    <p>
      In <m>\R^2</m>, each point is represented by an ordered pair of real numbers. 
      Then we can define the <term>components</term> of a vector using the ordered pairs of the two points as follows.
    </p>

    <definition xml:id="def-ComponentsVectorR2">
      <title>Components of a Vector</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The components of <m>\v{v} = \overrightarrow{PQ}</m>, where <m>P = (a_1, b_1)</m> and <m>Q = (a_2, b_2)</m>, are the quantities
          <md>
            a = a_2 - a_1 \quad \text{($x$-component)}\, , \qquad \qquad b = b_2 - b_1 \quad \text{($y$-component)}
          </md>
          The pair of components is denoted <m>\langle a,b \rangle</m>. 
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    
    <p>
      <term>P.S.:</term> If you are a linear algebra-ist and want to use the notation of the column vectors instead, be my guest! 
      Just remember that Richard prefers the column vector notation over the sharp-y angle bracket notation (but he is teaching calculus, not linear algebra, so he will have to live with it).
    </p>

    <example>
      <p>
        Find the components of the following vectors with tail <m>P</m> and tip <m>Q</m>. 
        Then sketch the vectors.  
      </p>

      <ol marker="(a)">
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>P_1 = (1,2)</m> and <m>Q_1 = (4,6)</m>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>P_2 = (-4,-2)</m> and <m>Q_2 = (-1,2)</m>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>P_3 = (2,-1)</m> and <m>Q_3 = (-3,-1)</m>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>P_4 = (-2,4)</m> and <m>Q_4 = (-5,1)</m>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <solution>
        <p>
          We can find the components of each vector using the definition: 
          <md>
            \v{v} = \la a_2 - a_1, b_2 - b_1 \ra
          </md>
        </p>
        <ol marker="a">
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>\v{v}_1 = \overrightarrow{P_1Q_1} = \la 4-1, 6-2 \ra = \la 3, 4 \ra</m>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>\v{v}_2 = \overrightarrow{P_2Q_2} = \la -1 - (-4), 2 - (-2) \ra = \la 3, 4 \ra</m>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>\v{v}_3 = \overrightarrow{P_3Q_3} = \la -3 - 2, -1 - (-1) \ra = \la -5, 0 \ra</m>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>\v{v}_4 = \overrightarrow{P_4Q_4} = \la -5 - (-2), 1 - 4 \ra = \la -3, -3 \ra</m>
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          The sketches of the vectors are shown below: 
        </p>

        <figure>
          <image source="sec121-VectorComponents-Example.png" width="60%"></image>
        </figure>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p>
      Observe that <m>\v{v}_1</m> and <m>\v{v}_2</m> are <em>parallel</em>. 
      Moreover, <m>\v{v}_2</m> is a translation of <m>\v{v}_1</m> (i.e., we can obtain <m>\v{v}_2</m> by sliding <m>\v{v}_1</m> to the left and down). 
      We call these two vectors <term>equivalent vectors</term> if one is a translation of the other.  
    </p>

    <p>
      In fact, two vectors are <term>equivalent</term> if and only if they have the same components. 
      So instead of studying millions of the same vectors in different locations, we can just study one representative vector for each group of equivalent vectors. 
    </p>

    <p>
      But which location should we choose for the representative vector? 
      To keep things easier, we usually choose the representative vector whose tail is at the origin <m>(0,0)</m>. 
      Then the tip of the vector is at the coordinate point <m>(a,b)</m>, where <m>\langle a,b \rangle</m> are the components of the vector.
      This is called the <term>position vector</term>. 
    </p>

    <example>
      <p>
        Sketch the position vectors of the vectors in the previous example. 
      </p>

      <solution>
        <p>
          The vectors in the previous example are

            \v{v}_1 = \v{v}_2 = \la 3, 4 \ra, \quad \v{v}_3 = \la -5, 0 \ra, \quad \v{v}_4 = \la -3, -3 \ra
          </md>
          The position vectors are sketched below.

    <title>The Attributes of Vectors</title>

    <p>
      When defining a vector, it is important to note its <term>magnitude</term> and the <term>direction</term>. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The <term>magnitude</term> of a vector <m>\v{v}</m> is the distance from the tail to the tip (aka the length of the vector). 
      This is denoted as <m>\|\v{v}\|</m>. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Given a vector <m>\v{v} = \langle a,b \rangle</m>, we can determine its magnitude using the Pythagorean Theorem, as demonstrated in the figure below. 
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="sec121-fig-VectorMagnitudeR2">
      <caption>The Magnitude of the vectors <m>\v{v}_0</m> and <m>\v{v}</m></caption>
      <image source="sec121-VectorMagnitude-R2.png" width="50%">
      </image>
    </figure>

    <p>
      By the Pythagorean Theorem, we have
      <md>
        <mrow> \|\v{v}\| \amp= \sqrt{(a_1 - a_2)^2 + (b_1 - b_2)^2} </mrow>
        <mrow> \amp= \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} </mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The magnitude of a vector is really called the <term><m>\boldsymbol{\ell^2}</m> norm</term> or the <term>Euclidean norm</term> of a vector in more advanced math courses.
      In general, norms must satisfy the following three properties: 
      <ol marker="1.">
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\|\v{v}\| \geq 0</m>, with <m>\|\v{v}\| = 0</m> if and only if <m>\v{v} = \v{0}</m>. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\| \lambda\v{v}\| = |\lambda|\|\v{v}\|</m> for all scalars <m>\lambda \in \R</m>. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\|\v{v} + \v{w}\| \leq \|\v{v}\| + \|\v{w}\|</m> for any two vectors <m>\v{v}</m> and <m>\v{w}</m>, with equallity only if <m>\v{v} = 0</m>, <m>\v{w} = 0</m>, or if <m>\v{w} = \lambda\v{v}</m> where <m>\lambda \geq 0</m>. 
            (This is the famous <term>triangle inequality</term>). 
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      This isn't a linear algebra or functional analysis class, so we won't go deeper into norms here. 
      If you are interested, feel free to do more digging on your own (or ask Richard!). 
    </p>

    <example>
      <p>
        Find the magnitude of the vectors in the previous examples.

          </md>
          Then

        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p>
      Now let's discuss the <term>direction</term> of a vector. 
      The direction of a vector tells us where the vector is pointing. 
      We can indicate the direction of a vector by using the vector itself. 
      As you imagine, the magnitude of a vector has nothing to do with its direction, so we sometimes use a <term>unit vector</term>, which is a vector of length <m>1</m>, to indicate the direction, when it is not necessary to specify length. 
    </p>

    <p>
      If we have a unit vector whose tail is at the origin, then its tip lies on the unit circle. 
      We usually denote a unit vector by <m>\v{e}</m>, defined as
      <md>
        \v{e} = \langle \cos(\theta), \sin(\theta)\rangle
      </md>
      where <m>\theta</m> is the angle between <m>\v{e}</m> and the positive <m>x</m>-axis, indicated in the figure below. 
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="sec121-fig-UnitVector-UnitCircle">
      <caption>The unit vector <m>\v{e}</m> on the unit circle</caption>
      <image source="sec121-UnitVector-UnitCircle.png" width="50%">
      </image>
    </figure>

    <p>
      But what if we are given an arbitrary non-zero vector and we want to find a unit vector in the same direction?
      One way to do so is to divide the vector by its magnitude (multiplying a positive scalar doesn't change the direction of a vector). 
      That is, given <m>\v{v}</m>, the unit vector in the direction of <m>\v{v}</m> is
      <md>
        \v{e_v} = \frac{1}{\|\v{v}\|}\v{v}
      </md>
    </p>

    <proof>
      <title>A quick proof to show that <m>\v{e_v}</m> is a unit vector</title>
      <p>
        Let <m>\v{v}</m> be a non-zero vector. 
        Then <m>\|\v{v}\| \gt 0</m>. 
        This implies that
        <md>
          <mrow>\|\v{e_v}\| \amp= \left\|\frac{1}{\|\v{v}\|}\v{v}\right\| </mrow>
          <mrow> \amp= \left|\frac{1}{\|\v{v}\|}\right| \|\v{v}\| \amp\amp\text{by the second norm property} </mrow>
          <mrow> \amp= \frac{1}{\|\v{v}\|}\|\v{v}\| \amp\amp\text{since } \frac{1}{\|\v{v}\|} \gt 0 </mrow>
          <mrow> \amp= 1 </mrow>
        </md>
        Hence, <m>\v{e_v}</m> is a unit vector. 
      </p>
    </proof>

    <p>
      When we are given the magnitude of a vector and its direction as the angle <m>\theta</m>, we can find the components of the vector as follows:
      <md>
        \v{v} = \la v_1, v_2 \ra = \|\v{v}\|\v{e_v} = \|\v{v}\|\la \cos(\theta), \sin(\theta) \ra = \la \|\v{v}\|\cos(\theta), \|\v{v}\|\sin(\theta) \ra
      </md>
    </p>

    <example>
      <p>
        Find the vector with magnitude <m>6</m> and make an angle of <m>\dfrac{4\pi}{3}</m> with the positive <m>x</m>-axis.
      </p>

      <hint>
        <title>If you want to see what the vector looks like...</title>
        <p>
          The goal of the question is to find the length of the red vector in the figure below. 
        </p>

        <figure>
            <image source="sec121-VectorDirectionMagnitude-Example.png" width="50%"></image>
        </figure>
      </hint>

      <solution>
        <p>
          We can first find the unit vector in the direction of the vector:
          <md>
            \v{e_v} = \la \cos\lp \frac{4\pi}{3} \rp, \sin\lp \frac{4\pi}{3} \rp \ra = \la -\frac{1}{2}, -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \ra
          </md>
          Then the vector with magnitude <m>6</m> in the same direction is
          <md>
            \v{v} = \la 6 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right), 6 \cdot \left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) \ra = \la -3, -3\sqrt{3} \ra
          </md>
          
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p>
      Observe that we essentially multiplied the unit vector (a vector) by the magnitude (a scalar) to obtain the desired vector. 
      This is one of the two operations in vector algebra, which we will discuss in the next section.
    </p>
  </subsection>

  <subsection xml:id="subsec-VectorAlgebra">
    <title>Vector Algebra</title>

    <p>
      Vectors live in a place called the <term>vector space</term>. 
      Usually, two operations are defined in a vector space, and they are <term>vector addition</term> and <term>scalar multiplication</term>. 
      We will discuss these two operations in this section. 
    </p>

    <p>
      <term>Vector addition</term> tells us how to <em>add two vectors</em> together. 
      Geometrically speaking, we can imagine a vector as the movement from the tail to the tip. 
      Then adding two vectors means performing the movements one after another. 
      That is, we will need to find the equivalent vector of the second vector <em>whose tail is at the tip of the first vector</em>, and the resulting vector is the vector from the tail of the first vector to the tip of the second vector. 
      This is sometimes referred to as the <term>Triangle Law</term>. 
    </p>

    <figure>
      <image source="sec121-VectorAddition-Triangle.png" width="60%"></image>
      <caption>Vector Addition using the Triangle Law</caption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      But sometimes we are given the position vectors and their tails are both at the origin (or at the same point). 
      Alternatively, rather than finding the equivalent vector of the second vector, we can construct a parallelogram using the two vectors as adjacent sides, and the resulting vector is the diagonal of the parallelogram starting from the common tail of the two vectors. 
      This is called the <term>Parallelogram Law</term>. 
    </p>

      <caption>Vector Addition using the Parallelogram Law</caption>
    </figure>

    
    <note>
      <title>But Richard... Aren't these two laws essentially the same thing? Why splitting hairs and call them two things? </title>
      <p>
        While these two laws are essentially the same, they represent two different actions in context. 
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              The triangle law represents <em>sequentially</em> performing two movements one after another. 
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The parallelogram law represents combining two movements happening <em>at the same time</em>.

      Now let's look at <term>scalar multiplication</term>. 
      The term <alert>scalar</alert> refers to a real number. 
      That is, scalar multiplication tells us how to multiply a vector by a real number. 
      The scalar will "scale" or "resize" the vector. 
    </p>

    <p>
      When the scalar is positive, the resulting vector points in the same direction, and the size of the vector is scaled by the scalar. 
    </p>

    </figure>

    <p>
      When the scalar is negative, the resulting vector points in the opposite direction, and the size of the vector is scaled by the absolute value of the scalar. 
    </p>

    </figure>

    <p>
      But what if the scalar is zero? 
      We can quickly see that the magnitude of the resulting vector is zero, so the resulting vector is the <term>zero vector</term>, denoted by <m>\v{0}</m>. 
      We can imagine the zero vector  has the tail and tip at the same point, which means it doesn't have a specific direction. 
      Alternatively, we can say that the zero vector points in <em>all</em> directions. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Once we have vector addition and scalar multiplication defined, we can subtract two vectors. 
      Recall subtraction is really the same thing as adding the opposite. 
      That is, 
      <md>
        \v{v} - \v{w} = \v{v} + (-\v{w})
      </md>
      Graphically, we can find <m>\v{v} - \v{w}</m> as follows:
    </p>

      <image source="sec121-VectorSubtraction.png" width="80%"></image>
      <caption>Vector Subtraction</caption>
    </figure>
    
    <p>
      But we work with components of vectors as well... 
      How do we perform these operations using components? 
      It turns out that vector addition and scalar multiplication can be performed <em>component-wise</em>.

    <subsubsection xml:id="subsubsec-LinearCombinations">
      <title>Linear Combinations of Vectors</title>
      <p>
        Given two vectors <m>\v{v}</m> and <m>\v{w}</m>, we define a <term>linear combination</term> of them as a vector of the form
        <md>
          r\v{v} + s\v{w}
        </md>
        where <m>r</m> and <m>s</m> are scalars. 
        Linear combinations are the fundamental mechanism for "building" new vectors from existing ones.
      </p>

      <example>
        <p>
          Express <m>\v{u}</m> as a linear combination <m>\v{u} = r\v{v} + s\v{w}</m>, where
          <md>
            \v{u} = \la 6,-2 \ra , \qquad \v{v} = \la 1,1 \ra \quad \text{and} \quad \v{w} = \la 1,-1 \ra
          </md>
          Then sketch <m>\v{u}</m>, <m>\v{v}</m>, <m>\v{w}</m>, and the parallelogram formed by <m>r\v{v}</m> and <m>s\v{w}</m>.
        </p>

        <hint>
          <p>
            Consider the vectors <m>\v{v}</m> and <m>\v{w}</m> are the two building blocks that we can use to construct the vector <m>\v{u}</m>. 
            The moves we can do are the scalar multiplications (to resize the building blocks) and the vector addition (to combine the building blocks). 
          </p>

          <p>
            So, the question here is: how should we <em>resize</em> the building blocks <m>\v{v}</m> and <m>\v{w}</m> such that when we combine them together, we get the desired vector <m>\v{u}</m>? 
          </p>
        </hint>

        <solution>
          <p>
            Using the definition of linear combinations, there are two scalars <m>r</m> and <m>s</m> such that
            <md>
              <mrow>\v{u} = \la 6,-2 \ra = r\v{v} + s\v{w} \amp= r\la 1,1 \ra + s\la 1,-1 \ra </mrow>
              <mrow> \amp= \la r,r \ra + \la s,-s \ra </mrow>
              <mrow> \amp= \la r + s, r - s \ra </mrow>
            </md>
            This implies that
            <md>
              \begin{cases}
                r + s = 6 \\ 
                r - s = -2
              \end{cases}
            </md>
            Solving this system of equations, we obtain <m>r = 2</m> and <m>s = 4</m>. 
            Hence, the linear combination is
            <md>
              \v{u} = 2\v{v} + 4\v{w}
            </md>
            The sketches of the vectors and the parallelogram are shown below. 
          </p>

          </figure>
        </solution>
      </example>

      <p>
        One of the reasons why linear combinations are important is that we can decompose vectors into linear combinations of other vectors. 
        Usually, we want to decompose vectors into linear combinations of the simplest vectors possible. 
        In <m>\R^2</m>, the simplest vectors are the <term>standard basis vectors</term>, defined as
        <md>
          \v{i} = \la 1,0 \ra \quad \text{and} \quad \v{j} = \la 0,1 \ra
        </md>
        Any vector in <m>\R^2</m> can be expressed as a linear combination of these two vectors. 
        Or using fancy linear algebra terminology, the set <m>\{\v{i},\v{j}\}</m> <em>spans</em> the vector space <m>\R^2</m>.
      </p>

          Calculate the linear combination <m>-\dfrac{3}{2}\v{i} + 5\lp \dfrac{1}{2}\v{j} - \dfrac{1}{2}\v{i} \rp</m>
        </p>

        <hint>
          <p>
            The building blocks here are the standard basis vectors <m>\v{i} = \la 1,0 \ra</m> and <m>\v{j} = \la 0,1 \ra</m>. 
            So we will need to perform scalar multiplications and vector additions to obtain the resulting vector.

    <title>Applications of Vectors</title>
    
    <p>
      Vectors are widely used in various fields, including physics, engineering, computer science, and more. 
      They are particularly useful in representing quantities that have both magnitude and direction, such as velocity, force, and acceleration. 
      In this section, we will explore a basic application of vectors: force vectors.
    </p>

    <example>
    <title>Force Vectors</title>
      <p>
        A 400-lb engine is suspended from two chains that form 60° angles with a horizontal ceiling. 
        How much weight does each chain support? 
      </p>

      <figure>
        <image source="sec121-ForceVectors-Diagram.png" width="50%"></image>
      </figure>

      <hint>
        <p>
          Let <m>\v{F}_1</m> and <m>\v{F}_2</m> denote the forces exerted by the chains on the engine and let <m>\v{F}_3</m> be the downward force due to the weight of the engine. 
          Then we can place the origin at the point where the engine is located and construct a Cartesian coordinate plane. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Then we can draw the vectors <m>\v{F}_1</m>, <m>\v{F}_2</m>, and <m>\v{F}_3</m>. 
          Can we find the components of these vectors? 
        </p>

        <p>
          Since the engine is stationary, the forces must be balanced. 
          That is, adding these three vectors together must give us the zero vector. 
        </p>
      </hint>

      <solution>
        <p>
          Following the setup in the hint, we can construct a Cartesian coordinate plane with the origin at the engine. 
          Then the vectors are 
          <md>
            \v{F}_1 =  \la \|\v{F}_1\| \cos\lp 60^\circ \rp, \|\v{F}_1\| \sin\lp 60^\circ \rp \ra = \la \frac{1}{2}\|\v{F}_1\|, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\|\v{F}_1\| \ra
          </md>
          <md>
            \v{F}_2 =  \la \|\v{F}_2\| \cos\lp 120^\circ \rp, \|\v{F}_2\| \sin\lp 120^\circ \rp \ra = \la -\frac{1}{2}\|\v{F}_2\|, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\|\v{F}_2\| \ra
          </md>
          <md>
            \v{F}_3 = \la 0, -400 \ra
          </md>
        </p>

        <figure>
          <image source="sec121-ForceVectors-Solution-Diagram.png" width="50%"></image>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Since the engine is stationary, we have
          <md>
            \v{F}_1 + \v{F}_2 + \v{F}_3 = \v{0}
          </md>
          This implies that
          <md>
            \la \frac{1}{2}\|\v{F}_1\| - \frac{1}{2}\|\v{F}_2\|, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\|\v{F}_1\| + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\|\v{F}_2\| - 400 \ra = \la 0,0 \ra
          </md>
          Equating the components, we obtain the system of equations:
          <md>
            \begin{cases}
              \dfrac{1}{2}\|\v{F}_1\| - \dfrac{1}{2}\|\v{F}_2\| = 0 \\ 
              \dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\|\v{F}_1\| + \dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\|\v{F}_2\| - 400 = 0
            \end{cases}
          </md>
          Solving this system, we find that <m>\|\v{F}_1\| = \|\v{F}_2\| = \dfrac{400}{\sqrt{3}} \approx 230.94</m> lbs.
        </p>

        <p>
          Hence, each chain must be able to support a weight of approximately 230.94 lbs.
