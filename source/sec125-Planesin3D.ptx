    <title>Assigned Problems for Section 12.5</title>
    
    <introduction>
      <p>
        The problems listed below are assigned to be included in your problem set portfolio. 
        Note that a specific selection of these problems will also form the written homework assignments. 
        I recommend working through all of them to ensure a solid grasp of the material. 
        Reach out to Richard for help if you get stuck or have any questions.
      </p>

      <p>
        The solutions will be posted after the written homework due dates. 
        If you have any questions about your work, talk to Richard and he is happy to discuss the process with you.

    <exercise number="12.5.59">
      <p>
        By definition, the angle between two planes is the angle between their <alert>normal vectors</alert>.

      <p>
        Compute the angle between the two planes <m>2x + 3y + 7z = 2</m> and <m>4x - 2y + 2z = 4</m>.

    <exercise number="12.5.67">
      <p>
        Let <m>\c{L}</m> denote the line of intersection of the planes <m>x - y - z = 1</m> and <m>2x + 3y + z = 2</m>.

      <hint>
        <p>
          To find a point on <m>\c{L}</m>, substitute an arbitrary value for <m>z</m> (say, <m>z = 2</m>) and then solve the resulting pair of equations for <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
