    <introduction>
      <p>
        Below are the suggested problems for this section. 
        Some of the problems will become part of your homework assignments. 
        I suggest you work out all the problems to get a good grasp of the material. 
        Reach out to Richard for help if you get stuck or have any questions. 
      </p>

      <p>
        The solution will be posted after the homework due dates. 
        If you have any question about your work, talk to Richard and he is happy to discuss the process with you.
