  <title>Vector-Valued Functions</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      In single-variable calculus, we studied functions of the form <m>y=f(x)</m>, which result in graphs that are curves in the <m>xy</m>-plane. 
      In linear algebra or the previous chapter, we studied vectors, which represent magnitude and direction but are static. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In this section, we combine these concepts to define <term>vector-valued functions</term>. 
      By allowing the components of a vector to be functions of a parameter <m>t</m> (often representing time), we can describe dynamic motion in space.

    Imagine you are tracking the position of a particle moving in <m>\R^2</m>. 
    At any time <m>t</m>, the position of the particle can be represented by a vector <m>\v{r}(t) = \la x(t), y(t) \ra</m>, where <m>x(t)</m> and <m>y(t)</m> are functions that describe the particle's coordinates in the plane. 
    As time progresses, the tip of the vector <m>\v{r}(t)</m> traces out a path in the plane, known as a <term>Plane Curve</term>.
  </p>

  </figure>

  <p>
    Similarly, if the particle is moving in <m>\R^3</m>, at any time <m>t</m>, the position of the particle can be represented by a vector <m>\v{r}(t) = \la x(t), y(t), z(t) \ra</m>, where <m>x(t)</m>, <m>y(t)</m>, and <m>z(t)</m> are functions that describe the particle's coordinates in <m>\R^3</m>. 
    As time progresses, the tip of the vector <m>\v{r}(t)</m> traces out a path in space, known as a <term>Space Curve</term>.

  <p>
    The function <m>\v{r}(t)</m> is called a <term>Vector-Valued Function</term> because it assigns a vector to each value of the parameter <m>t</m>. 
    In <m>\R^3</m>, a vector-valued function is typically expressed as 
    <md>
      \v{r}(t) = \la x(t), y(t), z(t) \ra
    </md>
    where <m>t</m> is called the <term>parameter</term> of the function, and <m>x(t)</m>, <m>y(t)</m>, and <m>z(t)</m> are the <term>component</term> or <term>coordinate functions</term> that determine the coordinates of the vector in space. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Note that the parameter <m>t</m> often represents time, but it can represent other quantities as well. 
  </p>

  <subsection xml:id="subsec-BasicVectorValuedFunctions">
    <title>Domain, Path, and Curve</title>

    <p>
      Now that we have a function, we want to understand its domain. 
      The <term>domain</term> of a vector-valued function is the set of all possible values of the parameter <m>t</m> for which all the component functions are defined.
    </p>

    <example>
      <p>
        What is the domain of <m>\v{r}(t) = \la t^3, \ln(3-t), \sqrt{t} \ra</m>?
      </p>

      <hint>
        <p>
          The component functions are 
          <md>
            x(t) = t^3\, , \qquad y(t) = \ln(3-t)\, , \qquad z(t) = \sqrt{t}
          </md>
          We can find their domains individually. 
        </p>

        <p>
          The domain of <m>\v{r}(t)</m> must be the set of all <m>t</m> values for which all three component functions are defined. 
          How can we find a set of <m>t</m> values that works for all three component functions? 
        </p>
      </hint>

      <solution>
        <p>
          The domain of <m>x(t) = t^3</m> is <m>(-\infty, \infty)</m> because the cubic function is defined for all real numbers. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The domain of <m>y(t) = \ln(3-t)</m> is <m>(-\infty, 3)</m> because the natural logarithm function is only defined for positive arguments.
        </p> 
        <p>
          The domain of <m>z(t) = \sqrt{t}</m> is <m>[0, \infty)</m> because the square root function is only defined for non-negative numbers.
        </p>

        <p>
          To find the domain of <m>\v{r}(t)</m>, we need to find the intersection of the domains of the three component functions to ensure that all components are defined. 
          That is, the domain of <m>\v{r}(t)</m> is 
          <md>
            (-\infty, \infty) \cap (-\infty, 3) \cap [0,\infty)
          </md>
          which simplifies to <m>[0, 3)</m>. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Hence, the domain of <m>\v{r}(t)</m> is <m>D = \left\{ t \in \R \mid 0 \leq t \lt 3 \right\}</m>. 
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p>
      There are two things we are discussing here: 
      the <term>path</term> parametrized by <m>\v{r}(t)</m> and the <term>curve</term> <m>\c{C}</m> traced by the tip of the vector <m>\v{r}(t)</m>. 
      <ul marker="">
        <li>
          <p>
            The <term>path</term> is the vector-valued function <m>\v{r}(t)</m> itself. 
            It describes how the curve is traversed as the parameter <m>t</m> varies. 
            You can think of it as the specific trip you take along that road. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The <term>curve</term> <m>\c{C}</m> is the set of points in space. 
            It is a static geometric object left behind by the path. 
            You can think of it as the physical road on a map. 
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, let's say we have the vector-valued function
      <md>
        \v{r}(t) = \la \cos(t), \frac{t}{2}, \sin(3t) \ra 
      </md>
      where <m>-3\pi \leq t \leq 3\pi</m>. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The path is the function <m>\v{r}(t)</m> itself, which describes how the curve is traced out as <m>t</m> varies from <m>-3\pi</m> to <m>3\pi</m> (see the figure below). 
    </p>

      <caption>The Path of <m>\v{r}(t)</m></caption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      The curve <m>\c{C}</m> is the set of points in space traced out by the tip of the vector <m>\v{r}(t)</m> as <m>t</m> varies from <m>-3\pi</m> to <m>3\pi</m> (see the figure below).

  <subsection xml:id="subsec-Projection_VectorValuedFunctions">
    <title>Projections of Vector-Valued Functions</title>
    
    <p>
      Next, let's discuss how to describe the curve traced by a vector-valued function. 
      One way to do so is to eliminate one variable through <alert>projection onto a coordinate plane</alert>. 
      Then we can easily describe the resulting curve in two dimensions. 
    </p>

    <example>
      <p>
        The curve traced by <m>\v{r}(t) = \la -\sin(t), \cos(t), t \ra</m> for <m>t \geq 0</m> is called a <term>helix</term>. 
        Describe the curve in terms of its projections onto the coordinate planes.
      </p>

      <hint>
        <p>
          We can project the curve onto the standard <m>xy</m>-plane, <m>yz</m>-plane, and <m>xz</m>-plane by setting the appropriate coordinate to zero. 
          Then we can observe the resulting curves in two dimensions. 
        </p>
      </hint>

      <solution>
        <p>
          By setting <m>z = 0</m>, we project the curve onto the <m>xy</m>-plane. 
          The projection is given by <m>\v{p}(t) = \la -\sin(t),\cos(t),0 \ra</m>. 
          This implies that
          <md>
            x(t) = -\sin(t) \, , \qquad y(t) = \cos(t)
          </md>
          Squaring and adding these equations gives 
          <md>
            x^2 + y^2 = \sin^2(t) + \cos^2(t) = 1
          </md>
          Hence, the projection onto the <m>xy</m>-plane is a circle of radius <m>1</m> centered at the origin. 
        </p>

        <p>
          By setting <m>x = 0</m>, we project the curve onto the <m>yz</m>-plane. 
          The projection is given by <m>\la 0, \cos(t), t \ra</m>. 
          This implies that
          <md>
            y(t) = \cos(t) \, , \qquad z(t) = t
          </md>
          We can simply express <m>y</m> in terms of <m>z</m> as <m>y = \cos(z)</m>. 
          Hence, the projection onto the <m>yz</m>-plane is a cosine curve that oscillates between <m>1</m> and <m>-1</m> as <m>z</m> increases. 
        </p>

        <p>
          By setting <m>y = 0</m>, we project the curve onto the <m>xz</m>-plane. 
          The projection is given by <m>\la -\sin(t), 0, t \ra</m>. 
          This implies that
          <md>
            x(t) = -\sin(t) \, , \qquad z(t) = t
          </md>
          We can simply express <m>x</m> in terms of <m>z</m> as <m>x = -\sin(z)</m>. 
          Hence, the projection onto the <m>xz</m>-plane is a negative sine curve that oscillates between <m>1</m> and <m>-1</m> as <m>z</m> increases.
        </p>

        <p>
          The diagram below summarizes the projections of the helix onto the three coordinate planes.

    <p>
      Projections are useful not only for visualizing curves in <m>\R^3</m>, but also for analyzing the curves in <m>\R^3</m>. 
      That is, by studying the projections onto the coordinate planes, we can obtain the vector-valued function of the curve in <m>\R^3</m>.

      <hint>
        <p>
          To match the vector-valued functions with the space curves, we can analyze the projections of each curve onto the coordinate planes. 
          By examining the behavior of the projections, we can identify which vector-valued function corresponds to each curve.

              <m>\mathbf{r}(t) = \langle t \cos(t), t, t \sin(t) \rangle</m> corresponds to graph <strong>II</strong>.
              Observe that <m>x^2 + z^2 = t^2 \cos^2(t) + t^2 \sin^2(t) = t^2 = y^2</m>. This indicates the curve lies on the cone <m>y^2 = x^2 + z^2</m>. The spiral radius increases as the variable <m>y</m> increases, which matches graph II.

              <m>\mathbf{r}(t) = \langle \cos(t), \sin(t), \frac{1}{1+t^2} \rangle</m> corresponds to graph <strong>VI</strong>.
              Here, <m>x^2 + y^2 = 1</m>, so the curve lies on a cylinder. The <m>z</m>-component <m>z = \frac{1}{1+t^2}</m> peaks at <m>z=1</m> and approaches <m>0</m> as <m>t \to \pm \infty</m>. Graph VI shows a spiral on a cylinder that rises to a peak and flattens out towards the bottom, matching this behavior.

              <m>\mathbf{r}(t) = \langle t, \frac{1}{1+t^2}, t^2 \rangle</m> corresponds to graph <strong>V</strong>.
              Notice that <m>z = t^2 = x^2</m>, meaning the curve lies on the parabolic cylinder <m>z = x^2</m>. As <m>x</m> moves away from zero, <m>z</m> increases quadratically while <m>y</m> approaches zero. This matches the parabolic track seen in graph V.

              <m>\mathbf{r}(t) = \langle \cos(t), \sin(t), \cos(2t) \rangle</m> corresponds to graph <strong>I</strong>.
              The curve lies on the cylinder <m>x^2 + y^2 = 1</m>. Since all components are periodic, the curve is a closed loop. The <m>z</m>-component oscillates between <m>-1</m> and <m>1</m> with a frequency double that of the rotation in <m>xy</m>, creating the "saddle" shape seen in graph I.

              <m>\mathbf{r}(t) = \langle \cos(8t), \sin(8t), e^{0.8t} \rangle</m> corresponds to graph <strong>IV</strong>.
              This describes a helix on the cylinder <m>x^2 + y^2 = 1</m>. The <m>z</m>-component grows exponentially, which means the vertical spacing (pitch) between the coils increases as the curve rises. This is clearly visible in graph IV.

              Observe that <m>x + y = \cos^2(t) + \sin^2(t) = 1</m>. The curve is confined to the plane <m>x + y = 1</m>. As <m>z=t</m> increases, the point oscillates along a line segment in the <m>xy</m>-plane, creating the wave-like shape on a flat plane seen in graph III.

              This is the only closed loop among the graphs. Mathematically, this corresponds to the only function where all three components are periodic, meaning the curve eventually retraces its path.

              The graph shows a spiral expanding along the <m>y</m>-axis, forming a cone. This matches equation (a) because the radius of the spiral in the <m>xz</m>-plane is <m>\sqrt{(t\cos t)^2 + (t\sin t)^2} = |t|</m>, which equals the distance along the <m>y</m>-axis (<m>|y|</m>).

              The graph shows a wave confined to a flat vertical plane. This matches equation (f) because <m>x + y = \cos^2(t) + \sin^2(t) = 1</m>, meaning the curve lies entirely on the plane <m>x + y = 1</m>.

              The graph is a helix where the vertical distance between coils increases (the pitch widens). This matches equation (e) because the <m>z</m>-component grows exponentially (<m>e^{0.8t}</m>), causing the curve to rise faster and faster.

              The graph shows a parabolic shape where the <m>y</m>-coordinate approaches zero as the curve rises. This matches equation (c) because <m>z = x^2</m> (a parabola) and <m>y = \frac{1}{1+t^2}</m>, which approaches 0 as <m>t \to \infty</m>.

    <title>Parametrization of Vector-Valued Functions</title>
    
    <p>
      Parametrization is the process of expressing a curve using a vector-valued function. 
      That is, given a curve in space, we want to find a vector-valued function <m>\v{r}(t)</m> that traces out the curve as <m>t</m> varies over some interval. 
    </p>

    <p>
      There are generally two main approaches to parametrizing a curve. 
      <ul marker="">
        <li>
          <p>
            <alert>Method 1</alert>: picking one of the variables as the parameter and expressing the other variables in terms of that parameter.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <alert>Method 2</alert>: using known parametrizations of standard curves (e.g., circles)) and adjusting them to fit the given curve.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <example>
      <p>
        Find the parametrization of the curve <m>\c{C}</m> obtained by the intersection of the surfaces <m>x^2 + y^2 = 1</m> and <m>y + z = 2</m>.
      </p>

      <solution>
        <title>Using Method 1...</title>
        <p>
          We can use <m>y</m> as the parameter. 
        </p>

        <p>
          From the first surface, we have <m>x^2 + y^2 = 1</m>, so <m>x = \pm\sqrt{1-y^2}</m>, where <m>-1 \leq y \leq 1</m>.  
          From the second surface, we have <m>z = 2 - y</m>. 
        </p>

        <p>
          That is, the curve of intersection can be expressed as
          <md>
            \v{r}(t) = \la \pm\sqrt{1-t^2}, t, 2 - t \ra 
          </md>
          where <m>-1 \leq t \leq 1</m>. 
        </p>

        <p>
          <alert>Note:</alert> the <m>\pm</m> sign makes the <m>x</m>-component not a function of <m>t</m>. 
          In practice, we would split the parametrization into two separate parts: one for <m>x = \sqrt{1-t^2}</m> and another for <m>x = -\sqrt{1-t^2}</m>, each defined over the interval <m>-1 \leq t \leq 1</m>. 
        </p>
      </solution>

      <solution>
        <title>Using Method 2...</title>
        <p>
          We can use the standard parametrization of a circle in the <m>xy</m>-plane, and then adjust it to fit the given constraint. 
        </p>

        <p>
          The standard parametrization of the circle <m>x^2 + y^2 = 1</m> is 
          <md>
            x = \cos(t)\, , \qquad y = \sin(t)
          </md>
          for <m>0 \leq t \leq 2\pi</m>. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Next, we can use the second surface equation <m>y + z = 2</m> to express <m>z</m> in terms of <m>t</m>. 
          That is, <m>z = 2 - y = 2 - \sin(t)</m>. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Hence, the curve of intersection can be expressed as
          <md>
            \v{r}(t) = \la \cos(t), \sin(t), 2 - \sin(t) \ra
          </md>
          for <m>0 \leq t \leq 2\pi</m>.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p>
      Observe that there are infinitely many ways to parametrize a curve. 
      One way to check your answer is to literally graph the curve and the parametrization to see if they match.  
    </p>

    <p>
      We can graph the curves using the <url href="https://www.geogebra.org/3d?lang=en">GeoGebra 3D Graphing Calculator</url> or other 3D graphing software. 
      If you type "Curve(cos(t),sin(t),2-sin(t),t,0,2 π)" into GeoGebra, you will see that the curve of intersection is a slanted ellipse. 
      If you type "Curve(\sqrt{1-t^2},t,2-t,t,-1,1)" and "Curve(-\sqrt{1-t^2},t,2-t,t,-1,1)", you will also get the same slanted ellipse. 
    </p>

    <p>
      To make it more convincing, you can graph the two surfaces and see if the intersection is the slanted ellipse. 
    </p>

    While the ideas in this section doesn't seem too difficult, it does require some practice to get comfortable with them. 
    For example, Richard knew how to parametrize things because he knows the standard parametrizations of circles and stuff. 
    Practice will help you internalize these concepts!
